# Mastermind suite

Mastermind is a simple, yet fun game to play either alone or with friends. 
This github project aims to provide a couple of different ways to play, with the
online ones being interoperable 

## How to play
- Select how many colors there are and how many balls ther should be to chose from
- Each players plays simulatiously
- Randomly chose a sequence of colors
- If a color you chose is in the correct sequence, you get a white bead
- If a color you chose is also at the same place in the correct sequence, you get a black bead
- These beads have no value, they are simply an indicator as to how close you are to the 
  right sequence
- Find the correct answer in as little tries as possible to win!

## Implementations
This is a project from our school, which is probably also why you are reading this 
readme right now. Since we are learning python there, we are "forced" to use python 
for our implementations as well (Of course, with a little JS sprinkled in for the web frontend)

## Installation
(Since Im writing this readme before actually finishing my implementations, this is hard to say 
and will be updated once were done)
Either clone this repository if you are comfortable doing so, or check out my website (Which also acts as
a server for the game, if you dont want to host your own one!).
