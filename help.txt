1) A secret code is generated consisting of 5 colors (Colors will not repeat!)
2) Randomly chose a sequence of colors (Use format: "color, color, color, color")
3) If a color you chose is in the correct sequence, you get a white bead
4) If a color you chose is also at the same place in the correct sequence, you get a black bead
5) These beads have no value, they are simply an indicator as to how close you are to the right sequence
6) Find the correct answer in as little tries as possible to win!


The game will now start.
Good luck!
